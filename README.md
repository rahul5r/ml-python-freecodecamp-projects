# ðŸ§  Machine Learning with Python Projects â€“ freeCodeCamp Certification

This repository contains the 5 machine learning projects I completed as part of the [freeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/).

## ðŸ—‚ Projects

### 1. Rock Paper Scissors â€“ RNN Model
- Implemented a recurrent neural network that learns from the last 5 moves of the opponent.
- Predicts and counters the opponent to achieve >50% win rate.
- Techniques: TensorFlow, Sequence modeling.

### 2. Cat and Dog Image Classifier
- Transfer learning using VGG16 for binary image classification.
- Achieved high accuracy on unseen cat/dog images.

### 3. Book Recommendation Engine
- Built using K-Nearest Neighbors and cosine similarity with `scikit-learn`.
- Recommends similar books based on user preferences.

### 4. Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator
- Used linear regression to predict health insurance charges based on user attributes like age, BMI, smoking status.

### 5. SMS Spam Classifier
- LSTM-based text classification model.
- Classifies SMS messages into spam or ham categories.
